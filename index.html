    <h2>Make Rust Great Again</h2>
    <p>Rusticity is a modified Rust server with several quality of life plugins and <em>no</em> pay2win, <em>no</em> exploiting/cheating tolerated, and an emphasis on fun. The server features 3x XP / 3x gather, teleports, homes, clans, SIL, and many more features that enhance gaming while not diluting the excitement of combat and raiding. Rusticity aims to be the last great modified home for people who want a true Rust experience without the tedium of vanilla or the silliness of 10x arcade servers. Come play!</p>
